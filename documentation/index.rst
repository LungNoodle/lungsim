Welcome to the documentation for Aether!
========================================

Hello everyone! Welcome to the documentation for our lung code!

The first thing we need to do to get going using this code is to :doc:`acquire </acquiring>` it then we can :doc:`build </building>` the aether library.
Once we have built the library we can :doc:`run </running>` it.
Before you start to develop the code make sure you read the section on :doc:`testing </testing>`.
Lastly, before you ask to get your code merged make sure you have looked at the :doc:`modules </modules>` and :doc:`fortran styles </fortranstyles>` sections to ensure that you have followed the conventions for this codebase.

Thanks and enjoy!

Quick Start
===========

If you have all the requirements for building the aether libraries and bindings then the following commands are a quick description on how to get setup and using the library, for further information or clarification read the full documentation.
Quick start instructions for GNU/Linux and macOS (bash)::

  git clone https://github.com/LungNoodle/lungsim.git
  python -m venv venv-aether
  source venv-aether/bin/activate
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install numpy
  here=$(pwd)
  cmake -S lungsim -B build-lungsim -D Python_EXECUTABLE=$here/venv-aether/bin/python
  cd lungsim-build
  make
  pip install -e src/bindings/python
  
Quick start instructions for Windows (cmd)::

  git clone https://github.com/LungNoodle/lungsim.git
  python -m venv venv-aether
  venv-aether/Scripts/activate
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install numpy
  cmake -S lungsim -B build-lungsim -D Python_EXECUTABLE=%cd%/venv-aether/Scripts/python
  cd lungsim-build
  cmake --build . --config Release
  pip install -e src/bindings/python/Release
